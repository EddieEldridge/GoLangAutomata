# GoLang Automata
A regular expression engine build in GoLang

## Description
The aim of this project is to write a program in the Go programming language that can
build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text

## Developers
Edward Eldridge (G00337490)

## Program
The the program will be run in a command prompt interface

## Design
The program will be developed using the Go programming language, Visual Studio Code and Git.
